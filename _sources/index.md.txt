This project exports your local [Zotero] library to a usable HTML website.
This generated website has the following features:

* Easily access your papers, site snapshots, notes from a navigation tree.
* Provides metadata from collections and attachments (i.e. referenes etc).
* Display PDF papers and website snapshot (the latter as framed).
* Search function dynamically narrows down the papers you're looking for.
* Embed links to a specific collection, article, item, note etc.
* Export only a portion of your collection with regular expressions using the
  collection name.
* [BetterBibtex] integration.
* Snazzy look and feel from the latest [Bootstrap] CSS/Javascript library.


## Documentation

See the [full documentation](https://plandes.github.io/zotsite/index.html).


## Obtaining

The easist way to install the command line program is via the `pip` installer:
```bash
pip3 install zensols.zotsite
```

Binaries are also available on [pypi].


## Process

The tool does the following:

1. Exports the meta data (directory structure, references, notes, etc) from
   your [Zotero] library.  On MacOS, this is done by querying the file system
   SQLite DB files.
2. Copies a static site that enables traversal of the exported data.
3. Copies your [Zotero] stored papers, snapshot (sites) etc.
4. Generates a navigation tree to easily find your papers/content.


## Sample Site Demonstration

See the [live demo], which provides a variety of resources found in my own
library.  *Note:* To my knowledge, all of these resources are free to
distribute and violate no laws.  If I've missed one,
please [create an issue](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Requirements

[BetterBibtex] plugin for Zotero.


## Usage

The command line program has two modes: show configuration (a good first step)
and to create the web site.  You can see what the program is parsing from your
[Zotero] library:

```bash
zotsite print
```

To create the stand-alone site, run the program (without the angle brackets):

```bash
zotsite export
```

If your library is not in the default $HOME/zotero directory you will need to change that path by making a zotsite.conf config file:

```bash
zotsite export --collection zotsite.conf
```

This will create the html files in the directory ./zotsite

See [usage](doc/usage.md) for more information.


### Configuration File

Either an environment variable `ZOTSITERC` must be set or a `-c` configuration
option must be given and point to a file to customize how the program works.
See the test [configuration file] for an example and inline comments for more
detail on how and what can be configured.


## Ubuntu and Linux Systems with Python 3.5 or Previous Version

Please [read this issue](https://github.com/plandes/zotsite/issues/4) if you
are installing a Ubuntu or any Linux system with Python 3.5 or previous
version.


## Command Line Help

Command line usage as provided with the `--help` option:

```bash
Usage: zotsite [list|export|print] [options]:

This project exports your local Zotero library to a usable HTML website.

Options:
  -h, --help [actions]                         show this help message and exit
  --version                                    show the program version and exit
  --level X                                    the application logger level, X is one of: debug, err, info, warn
  -c, --config FILE                            the configuration file

Actions:
list                                           list all actions and help
  --lstfmt <json|name|text>              text  the output format for the action listing

export (default)                               generate and export the zotero website
  --collection REGEX                           a regular expression used to filter "collection" nodes
  -o, --outputdir DIR                          the directory to dump the site; default to configuration file
  -s, --show                                   whether to browse to the created site (needs "pip install zensols.showfile")

print                                          print (sub)collections and papers in those collections as a tree
  --collection REGEX                           a regular expression used to filter "collection" nodes
```


## Attribution

This software uses:
* Python 3
* [jQuery] version 3
* [DataTables] version 1.12
* [Bootstrap] version 4
* [Tree View] for Bootstrap
* [Popper] for tooltips
* [Copy to Clipboard] function


## Screenshot

Also see the [live demo].

## Todo

* Make the site portion a proper Javascript site.  Right now, all the `min`s
  are added in the distribution to same directory as
  the [main navigation/content](resources/site/src/js/zotero.js) file.
* Add functionality to the disabled *View* button that drills down in a paper
  and finds a PDF or site to view withouth the user having to do this.
* Use something like zotxt to make this work with a plugin rather than directly
  against the SQLite DB.
